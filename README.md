### What I learned

This project felt like an exercise in layouts: getting everything centered and spaced out correctly was the goal, without much decoration or excess. A neat and simple challenge to start going through Frontend Mentor. 

One of the tricker bits of it for me was getting the sizing just right - even still, I feel like the card is juuuuuust a hair off from the correct dimensions. But, I did get the line breaks in the text correct, and while that's a small detail in the grand scheme, it makes me happy that it came out right.

That drop shadow kept playing tricks on my eyes! At first I didn't notice it, but as I built I realized that the card just wasn't popping out against the background. With enough squinting and adjusting the screen brightness, I could see that little shadow hanging out, making all the difference. 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's Responsive Product Preview Card Component video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - Before taking on this challenge, I followed along with a couple of Kevin Powell's tutorials. This is the one that really helped me get a sense of how to view a design, break it down, and build it back myself.
